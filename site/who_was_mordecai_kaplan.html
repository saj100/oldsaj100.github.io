            <p>Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan (1881-1983) was both the founder of the
                Society for the Advancement of Judaism (SAJ) and the founding father
                of Reconstructionist Judaism. A seminal Jewish thinker and figure of great
                historical significance, he played a principal part in the creation of modern
                Judaism and was perhaps the preeminent American rabbi of the twentieth century.
                The quintessential synthesizer of American modernism and Jewish tradition, he might
                be thought of as a modern cross between Moses Maimonides and Baruch Spinoza, combining
                the rabbinic brilliance of the one with the philosophical radicalism of the other.
                More than a pure intellectual, Kaplan was actively engaged with Jewish communal
                lifeâ€”and the most lasting community institution he created, the SAJ, is today the
                living legacy of his extraordinary life.</p>
