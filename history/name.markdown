title: The Name SAJ
---
The first task Rabbi Kaplan’s group faced when forming a new synagogue in 1922 was to choose an appropriate name. Given its unique role as the pioneer outpost of what was hoped to be a nationwide Reconstructionist movement, conventional terms like “synagogue” or “congregation” or even “center” were eschewed in favor of “society.” As Kaplan later recalled, it was also suggested by a rival Upper West Side-born movement, Felix Adler’s Society for Ethical Culture. Yet unlike Adler’s secular humanist group, Kaplan’s would be an expressly religious enterprise—albeit ‘civilizational’ in scope and thereby as radical and forward-thinking as Ethical Culture. ‘Moving Judaism forward’ thus became the declared purpose of the new organization, stated clearly and unequivocally in its name: Society for the Advancement of Judaism.

The SAJ name is furthermore ingenious in that each constituent term is a double entendre and thus in good Jewish tradition multiple meanings can be read into it. “Society” can refer to either an aspirational club (as in Society for Ethical Culture) or to the organic community—a gemeinshaft— implied by Kaplan’s ideal of a ‘synagogue-center.’ “Advancement” can be taken to mean either ‘promotion of’ or ‘progressive change.’ And “Judaism” can be read either as ‘the Jewish religion’ or in Kaplan’s redefinition as ‘an evolving religious civilization.’ In sum, “SAJ” contains multitudes.
