The term “Reconstructionism” can be thought of in two distinct ways, as an ideology and as a movement.  In the first instance, it refers to the religious philosophy of Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan and his followers—offering an ideological program concerning the ‘reconstruction’ of traditional Jewish theology and practice and thus pointing toward a new American Judaism.  Kaplan began formulating his radical ideas in the 1910s and published his major statement of Reconstructionism, Judaism as a Civilization, in 1934.  The term can also refer to the institutional array of Reconstructionist synagogues, educational programs, publications, rabbinical assemblies and other organizations making up the movement in American Judaism called ‘Reconstructionism’ (recently renamed ‘Reconstructing Judaism’).  The two meanings of the term come together in the synagogue community founded by Rabbi Kaplan in 1922—the Society for the Advancement of Judaism (recently renamed ‘SAJ-Judaism that Stands for All’) which as the original Reconstructionist congregation became a key testing ground for Kaplan’s Reconstructionist philosophy.
