        <div class="home"><p>Welcome to “THE SAJ EXPERIENCE,” a virtual, online ‘museum exhibition’ celebrating the centennial anniversary of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism/SAJ: Judaism That Stands For All.  The ‘experience’ is a simulated tour of the SAJ building meant to tell the greater story of SAJ—its past, its purpose, its people—through five key themes corresponding to five key spaces in the building:</p>

<ol>
  <li>HISTORY – the building entrance</li>
  <li>RELIGION – the 1st floor sanctuary</li>
  <li>COMMUNITY – the 2nd floor social hall</li>
  <li>LEADERSHIP – the 2nd floor office suite</li>
  <li>EDUCATION – the 3rd floor school rooms</li>
</ol>

<p>You can navigate through the building by clicking with your mouse (or tapping with your finger if you are on a mobile device) to move about the building, and then clicking (or tapping) to select the highlighted round “tags” in each room, to view text, images, and videos about the topic of the room in which you are virtually located.</p>

<p>Throughout, we will highlight the creative tension at the heart of the SAJ, a dynamic interplay of the ideal and the real.  The Society for the Advancement of Judaism was originally founded by Mordecai Kaplan and his followers to be a new kind of ‘society’ spearheading an aspirational movement—aspiring to nothing less than the ‘reconstruction’ of Judaism in hopes of rebuilding Jewish life and saving the American Jewish future.  Animated by the vision articulated by Rabbi Kaplan and his fellow Reconstructionists, the SAJ was intended to be the model ‘American Synagogue’ (an early suggestion for the name of the new institution) and, as the first Reconstructionist congregation, it pioneered key aspects of 20th century American Judaism.</p>

<p>Yet the SAJ also developed the attributes of a conventional synagogue. As a beloved bet am (‘house of the people’) on the Upper Westside of Manhattan, it has a proud history of building community, offering religious services, teaching children and adults, celebrating holidays and family simchas, balancing budgets, raising funds, organizing events, planning calendars, publishing newsletters, offering cultural activities, supporting social causes, etc.—that is, all the many functions of a Jewish congregation in America.  In the end the SAJ is all that and more—as explored in multiple dimensions of virtual reality in ‘The SAJ Experience.’  We hope you enjoy!</p>
